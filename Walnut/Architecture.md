#  Notes

Right now, I'm running into a wall.

What's wrong?

- Table views need to reload (obviously)
- Table views need to have dynamic data (aka fetch results controllers)
- We need whatever is in a table view (text) and save it even if still editing
- Table view models get detached from cells

How to get around this problem?
* Use table view's diffable data source
*
